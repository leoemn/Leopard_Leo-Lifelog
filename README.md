# 🐆 Leopard_Leo – Lifelog

This is a small personal project to help me track my daily life, build habits, and stay consistent. I'm using it to gamify parts of my routine and slowly improve in areas like discipline, learning, fitness, and personal goals.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

- ✅ Stay consistent with daily tasks  
- 📈 Track XP in different categories (Strength, Intelligence, Discipline, Visa Quest)  
- 🧠 Understand mood, focus, and energy patterns  
- 🛠 Learn by building something useful

## 📊 What It Tracks

- **Daily logs** with:
  - 📅 Date, work hours, and notes
  - ✅ Tasks done + XP earned
  - 😊 Mood / ⚡ Energy / 🎯 Focus ratings
  - ⏰ Wake-up and 🛏 Sleep times

- **XP system**:
  - 💪 Strength / 🧠 Intelligence / 🎯 Discipline / 🛂 Visa Quest
  - 🎁 Rewards for 100 XP in a stat
  - ❌ Penalties for skipping key habits (like using the phone in the morning)

- **Streak tracking** for:
  - 🏃 Exercise
  - 🧹 Cleaning
  - 🗂 Visa-related work

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 📝 Markdown + Google Sheets
- 💻 Planning a basic web app for practice (maybe with React or something simple)

## 🚧 Still in Progress

This is evolving as I go. Some ideas for later:
- 📊 Progress charts
- 🖥 Basic UI for input
- ⚙️ Automation to reduce manual effort

Built for myself, by myself.  
Just trying to level up a little every day. 🎮
